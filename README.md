FOODit-MobileTest
=================

## Getting started

1. Fork this Github repository.

2. Clone your new repo.

3. Optional - Install Node.js dependencies to serve the menu data json.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. Optional - Run `grunt serve` to serve up your data file using a local Node (Connect) server. A browser window will open pointing to `data/menu.json` file. 

5. Commit/branch your stuff as you would normally. When you're finished, push your code to your Github repo, and drop us a link to it in email.

## What we expect from you

The Mobile Test is the same for both iOS and Andriod.
We have not included a starter application framework, please use one you are familiar with.

Your solution should take into account the following: 

- It should be as true to the designs as possible, but candidates should feel free to add anything that improves the flow/design, using touch and gestures where applicable.

- When the mobile is online, the application should cache the [menu data](/data/menu.json) in the mobile data store and periodically check for updates.
 
- The Application should continue to work while offline.

- The contents of the basket will be retained after the mobile or application has been restarted.

- A solution should show an understanding of the problems involved and make use of the tech stack to solve them.
